## User stories

User = Anyone who uses the application. 

Host = A user who owns a board. 

Guest = A user who collaborates to a board they do not own. 

1. As a host I want to be able to create an empty board to sketch something. 
2. As a user I want multiple tools that can edit the board so that I can easily sketch my ideas. 
3. As a user I want my work to be saved so that I can resume working after some time. 
4. As a host I want some way of sharing my work so that I can collaborate with other people. 
5. As a user I want my changes to the board to be seen in real time by other collaborators so that everyone always sees the latest version of the board. 
6. As a user I want some way of exporting my work from the web application to my own computer so that I can have a local copy of my work. 
7. As a host I want to be able to restrict the access to the board of the guests so that ill intended guests do not interfere with my work. 
8. As a guest I want to be able to access boards in order to collaborate with other users. 
9. As a user I want to be able to undo the board to a previous state so that I can discard any unwanted changes. 
10. As a user I want to be able to choose a nickname so that other users are aware of who I am.
